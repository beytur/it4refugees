/*
    Exercise5)

    Implement a function called 'drawDiamond' taking a parameter int called h.
    This function should print a diamond like this, where h is the 'height' of the diamond, so for e.g. h=9:
        1
       222
      33333
     4444444
    555555555
     4444444
      33333
       222
        1
     You are going to need odd numbers to do this, so just print 'No valid input!' if an even number or a number smaller
     than 0 is given. In case of 0 just leave the function right away without printing anything.


     This time try to avoid loops whenever possible!
     (it's hard, but possible, to solve this exercise without using any loops!)
     You will certainly have to write additional functions.
